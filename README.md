# Gesture Draw Trainer V1.4

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Nallen391/gesture-draw-trainer

A personal tool for timed gesture drawing practice. It shows you reference photos one at a time with a countdown timer, so you can practice sketching quickly under time pressure — then shows a grid of everything you drew from at the end of the session.

---

## What It Does

1. You pick a folder of reference images on your computer
2. You set how many images you want to see and how many seconds per image
3. The app shows each image fullscreen with a countdown timer
4. When the timer hits zero, it moves to the next image automatically
5. At the end of the session, all images are shown in a grid so you can review them

Images are shown in **random order** every session.

## How to Run It

> **Note:** The compiled `.exe` is not stored in the GitHub repo (it's excluded by .gitignore).
> If you cloned this from GitHub, use the Python method below. If you're working from the
> original OneDrive folder, the `.exe` is still there locally.

### Option A — Use the .exe (OneDrive copy only)

1. Open the `main_folder/dist/` folder
2. Double-click **Reference dealer v1.4.exe**
3. The launcher window will open — fill in your settings and click **Start Slideshow**

### Option B — Run with Python (works anywhere)

You'll need Python installed (version 3.x) and the Pillow library.

**Install Pillow once:**
```
pip install pillow
```

**Then launch the app:**
```
python Safe_Launcher.pyw
```

Or run the slideshow directly with arguments (folder path, number of images, seconds per image):
```
python main.pyw "C:\Your\Image\Folder" 15 30
```

## The Launcher Window

When you open the app, you'll see three fields:

| Field | What It Does | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Image Folder | Path to your reference photo folder (use Browse) | — |
| Number of Images | How many images to show in this session | 10 |
| Seconds per Image | How long each image stays on screen | 30 |

Click **Start Slideshow** when ready.

---

## During the Slideshow

- The image fills the window, resized to fit up to 800x600
- The title bar shows your progress (e.g. `3/10`)
- The timer counts down in seconds at the bottom

**Buttons:**

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| ⏮ Back | Go to the previous image |
| ⏸ Pause | Freeze the timer (click again to resume) |
| ⏭ Skip | Jump to the next image immediately |

---

## After the Session

When all images have been shown, a grid review appears:

- Up to 10 images: displayed in a 5-column grid with larger thumbnails
- More than 10 images: displayed in a 10-column grid with smaller thumbnails
- Each thumbnail is numbered so you can identify them
- The window is scrollable if there are many images

## Supported Image Formats

`.png` `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.gif` `.bmp`

## File Structure

```
gesture_draw_trainer_V1.4/
└── main_folder/
    ├── Safe_Launcher.pyw       ← Launch this to open the config window
    ├── main.pyw                ← Main slideshow logic (called by launcher)
    ├── gesture_draw_trainer.py ← All-in-one alternative version
    ├── slideshow.py            ← Grid review module
    ├── dist/                   ← Local only (gitignored) — contains the .exe
    ├── build/                  ← Local only (gitignored) — PyInstaller artifacts
    └── How to import to a new computer .txt  ← Setup notes
```

## Setting It Up on a New Computer

See `main_folder/How to import to a new computer .txt` for step-by-step notes.

Short version:
1. Copy the whole `gesture_draw_trainer_V1.4` folder to the new machine
2. Either run the `.exe` directly, or install Python + Pillow and run `Safe_Launcher.pyw`

---

## Dependencies

| Package | What it's for | How to install |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Python 3.x | Running the scripts | python.org |
| tkinter | The GUI windows | Included with Python |
| Pillow | Loading and resizing images | `pip install pillow` |

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

**Images not showing up?**
- Make sure the folder you selected actually contains `.jpg`, `.png`, or similar files
- The app searches the folder and all subfolders

**Timer not working / app freezes?**
- Close and relaunch
- If using the `.exe`, try running `Safe_Launcher.pyw` with Python instead

**No .exe in dist folder? (expected if cloned from GitHub)**
- The `.exe` is excluded from the repo — use `python Safe_Launcher.pyw` instead
- To rebuild the exe: run `pyinstaller Launcher.spec` from inside `main_folder/` (requires PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`)
